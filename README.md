This library allows you to easily log (with MDC) requests and responses by annotation of JAX-RS resources.

## Installation

The dependency is available in maven central (see badge for version):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.chavaillaz</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxrs-logging</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

The logging of requests and responses is done through a filter that can be activated on a resource with:

```java
@Logged(requestBody = true, responseBody = true)
```

It will add the following information to MDC for the request processing:

* Request identifier (from X-Request-ID header or random UUID)
* Request HTTP method
* Request URI path relative to the base URI
* Resource class matched by the current request
* Resource method matched by the current request

Once the response is computed, the request will be logged using the format:

```
Processed [method] [URI] with status [status] in [duration]ms
```

with the following MDC fields set:

* Response HTTP status
* Response duration in milliseconds
* Request and response body (if activated in annotation)

## Example

Given an endpoint on which users can create new articles, annotated with `@Logged`
(the annotation can also be on methods, for example in case of specific configuration):

```java
@Path("/article")
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Logged(requestBody = true, responseBody = true)
public class ArticleResource {

    @POST
    @Path("/create")
    public Article create(Article article) {
        // Creation of the article in the database
    }

}
```

When the following request is sent:

```
POST service.company.com/article
Content-Type: application/json

{ "content": "Something" }
```

Then the following log is written:

```
Processed POST /article with status 200 in 15ms
```

with the following MDC fields:

* `request-id: 02625ee3-03ae-4e26-a83b-74477c5824d2`
* `request-method: POST`
* `request-uri: /article`
* `request-body: { "content": "Something" }`
* `resource-class: ArticleResource`
* `resource-method: create`
* `response-status: 200`
* `response-body: { "id" : 1, "content": "Something" }`
* `duration: 15`
